                                  <p>Cactus is a wise plant that teaches us that from the blackest of soils could emerge the finest of flowers and that within the bitterness and despair could lie sweetness and hope . </p>
                                  <p>Cactus is a wild plant that resists a wild and, at times, cruel nature, patiently looking for a drop of water in the arid desert sands to quench its thirst and hopefully waiting for a ray of sunlight to restore it back to life. </p>
                                  <p>From this epic resistance, Cactus acquired its many benefits, which it hides behind a stolid mask of toughness and under a forbidding cover of thorns to ward off danger. <br />
                                    It is said that cactus has been known as a medicinal plant for over 5000 years. </p>
                                  <p>But it is a well documented fact that the prophet king ,Solomon, considered it an effective laxative, while Apocrates , the father of modern medicine, used 14 cactus-containing concoctions &amp; &nbsp;preparations around 2400 years ago ! <br />
                                    In many cultures &amp; civilizations cactus has been mentioned in medical journals dating back to the 2nd century before Christ as a magical , medicinal and mysterious plant , even though chemical analysis of organic matter hadn't been known until the 19th century ! </p>
                                  <p>And when such analysis was introduced in 1851 , it crystallized the viscous, bitter and dark cactus extract known as &quot; Aloin &quot; , which had been, until then , shrouded in mystery . </p>
                                  <p>Since 1930 a long list of distinguished scientists devoted themselves to an extensive study of cactus. Collins and Crow come at the head of that list, since they were the first to use cactus medicinally in the thirties as a cure for skin burns. </p>
                                  <p>In 1938 Chopia and Gosh identified the basic components of the plant. In 1941 ,Dr. Row &amp; Dr. LLoyed Parks published a detailed description of &nbsp;cactus , based on an extensive chemical analysis. </p>
                                  <p>The list of cactus converts contains the names of other great scientists such as , to name just a few, Lorinzini , G.D Pucci , Gerstadt , Roth Simms , Zimmerman, Danhoff, Fugita , H. Tsuda, EL-Zawahry , Higazy and others. </p>
                                  <p>This historic fascination with and interest in cactus is shared by the Spiros Constantine Moros Charity Foundation ,which is specially interested in Aloe Arborescens to the point of adopting a recipe composed of that particular type of cactus in combination with honey and liquor as a trusted cure for cancer . &nbsp; </p>
                                  <p>Cactus also provides cure for many other diseases in addition to its proven role in strengthening the immune system.
